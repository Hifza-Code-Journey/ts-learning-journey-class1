// Welcome to my TypeScript Learning Journey - Class 1!

// In this class, we explored the basics of TypeScript, including:
// - Understanding what TypeScript is and its significance in modern development.
// - Installing the TypeScript software to kickstart our coding journey.

// The excitement peaked as we wrote our first TypeScript code, a simple 'hello world' program:
console.log("Hello, World!");

// This humble line of code represents the beginning of an exciting odyssey into the world of TypeScript.
// Get ready for more coding adventures ahead! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
